CSAFE has access to Large Scale Storage (LSS) CSAFE Rstudio Servers The Pronto Job Scheduler 1.1 Large Scale Storage (LSS) ResearchIT at Iowa State University provides Large Scale Storage (LSS) at low cost to research labs. CSAFE has purchased more than 30 terabytes of space on LSS. As of 2022-06-17 the following CSAFE project folders are on LSS: csafe-admin-vid csafe-firearms csafe-handwriting csafe-handwriting-irb csafe-mentisdb csafe-mobile csafe-shoeprints csafe-stego csafe-transcripts csafe-wvmediaimp Chapter 3 explains how to connect to LSS. 1.2 CSAFE RStudio Servers CSAFE has access to two RStudio Servers. To the user, the experience is almost exactly the same as using RStudio on a personal computer. The main benefit of running RStudio on the server is that the server has more RAM and more cores than most personal computers. Chapter 4 explains how to use the Rstudio servers. 1.3 The Pronto Job Scheduler ResearchIT at ISU manages a whole host of high performance servers to which CSAFE has purchased access. Instead of accessing one of these servers individually, users submit their jobs (scripts) to the Pronto Job Scheduler which assigns the jobs to the most appropriate servers. Chapter 5 explains how to run R scripts on the Pronto Job Scheduler. Python, MATLAB, and other programming languages can be run on Pronto, but this book only covers R. 1.4 Do I use the CSAFE Rstudio Server or Pronto? When deciding whether to use an RStudio server or Pronto, you might want to consider the following benefits and drawbacks of each. RStudio Server benefits It runs the RStudio graphical user interface so the user experience is quite similar to working in Rstudio on a personal computer. drawbacks Each server has less than 20 cores It is a shared user machine which means that if a lot of people are using the server, your jobs might run slower. Pronto benefits It has dozens of servers with hundreds of cores each It manages the resources for users so you don’t have to worry about slowing down other peoples jobs drawbacks It doesn’t have a graphical user interface so users interact with Pronto through the command line Users submit their jobs to Pronto using something called a SLURM script, which is quite a different workflow compared running scripts in Rstudio "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 2 Getting Started 2.1 Quick Start Guide 2.2 Working Off Campus", " Chapter 2 Getting Started If you are working from off campus you need to use ISU’s virtual private network (VPN) to connect to any of the computing resources covered in this guide. You also need to set up SSH keys. Section (off-campus) explains how to install and use the ISU VPN and SSH keys. If you will only be working on campus, you may skip this section. This chapter also includes a Quick Start Guide (Section (quick-start)) for people who are already comfortable with virtual private networks and command line prompts. The last section in this chapter explains how people are granted access to the computing resources covered in this guide. 2.1 Quick Start Guide 2.1.1 Connect to Large Scale Storage If you are an undergraduate student, use your CSAFE email net-id and password in the following steps. If you are off campus, download the ISU virtual private from https://vpn.iastate.edu and log-in using your ISU net-id and password.

Most users use their net-id as the folder name, but I think you can name it anything you want. The work directory is not backed-up so don’t use this folder for long term storage. Each user also has a home folder. These folders have limited storage so researchIT recommends only placing small files in the home folder.

Go to https://researchit.las.iastate.edu/how-transfer-files-pronto-globus to download Globus. Instructions for transferring data with Globus are here: https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/. 5.3 Running an R script on Pronto There are two ways to run a script on Pronto: in an interactive session as a batch job If I understand correctly, an interactive session is intended for troubleshooting your code. ResearchIT says, “Once you’ve got your program running in an interactive session please switch to an sbatch script if possible.” [https://researchit.las.iastate.edu/pronto?msclkid=3263c889c17811ec81e13068586d8872] Pronto uses the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (Slurm) to allocate resources (computer nodes and clusters) to users [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager]. In order to run your script as a batch job, you need to write a Slurm file that includes information about your job and the resources your would like to request. 5.4 Interactive Sessions 5.4.1 Example: Start an interactive session If you are off campus, connect to the ISU VPN (see ??) Sign-in to Pronto (see 5). In the Pronto terminal, type $ srun --nodes 1 --tasks 4 --partition interactive --time 01:00:00 --pty bash This starts an interactive session. Load the module for R version 4.0.4. This version of R requires that a specific version of gcc be loaded first. $ module load gcc/10.2.0-zuvaafu $ module load r/4.0.4-py3-4khjixy Tell Pronto to install R packages in your csafe-lab work folder. (This is considered the best practice by ResearchIT https://researchit.las.iastate.edu/how-run-r-pronto?msclkid=865a487bc65e11ecbfd7e59a7ab1dc47.) $ export R_LIBS_USER=/work/LAS/your-lab/yournetid/Rlibs $ mkdir -p $R_LIBS_USER Start the R interpreter $ R 5.4.2 Example: Install a package from CRAN Start an interactive R session (see 5.4.1) &gt; install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;,lib=&quot;/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/Rlibs&quot;, repos=&quot;https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN&quot;) 5.4.3 Example: Install a package from Github Occasionally, you might want to install a package that isn’t available on CRAN but is available on GitHub. This example shows how to do that on Pronto. Start an interactive R session (see 5.4.1) If you haven’t already, you need to install the devtools package &gt; install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;,lib=&quot;/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/Rlibs&quot;, repos=&quot;https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN&quot;) Every GitHub repository url has the format https://github.com/GithubUsernam/GithubRepo. Use the GithubUsername/GithubRepo in the install_github function. &gt; devtools::install_github(&quot;GithubUsername/GithubRepo&quot;) 5.5 Batch Jobs 5.5.1 Example: A basic R script If you are off campus, connect to the ISU VPN (see ??) Sign-in to Pronto (see 5). Open your csafe-lab work folder prontodtn.las.iastate.edu &gt; work &gt; LAS &gt; csafe-lab &gt; your_netid (see 5.2) Create a new R script with the following lines of code: a = 5 print(a) Save the script as basic.R. Copy the script to your csafe-lab work folder. Create a text file for Slurm with the following text: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --nodes=1 # request one node #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 # ask for 1 cpu #SBATCH --mem=1G # asks for 1 GB of RAM #SBATCH --time=00:30:02 # ask that the job be allowed to run for 30 minutes and 2 seconds. # everything below this line is optional #SBATCH --output=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_out.txt # store console output #SBATCH --error=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_err.txt # store error messages module load r cd /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid R --save &lt; basic.R Save the file as basic.txt. (Windows Only) If you are using Windows, your text file will likely have DOS line breaks instead of UNIX line breaks which will cause an error when the file is run on Pronto. Open Terminal in RStudio, use cd folder/containing/text_file to change directories to the folder containing your text file, and type dos2unix basic.txt to change the line breaks to UNIX format. Copy the text file to your csafe-lab work folder. In the command line prompt where you are connected to Pronto, type $ sbatch /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/basic.txt This will add your job to the queue. The script is so short, your job will probably run immediately. Two new files – job_&lt;job#&gt;_err.txt and job_&lt;job#&gt;_out.txt – should appear in your csafe-lab work folder. If basic.R ran successfully, the job_&lt;job#&gt;_out file should contain &gt; a = 5 &gt; print(a) [1] 5 &gt; and job_&lt;job#&gt;_err.txt should be blank. If the error file isn’t blank, troubleshoot the error(s). If you get stuck, email researchit@iastate.edu. 5.5.2 Example: Save a dataframe to a CSV file In this example, I will show you how to save a dataframe to a csv file. If you are off campus, connect to the ISU VPN (see ??) Sign-in to Pronto (see 5). Open your csafe-lab work folder prontodtn.las.iastate.edu &gt; work &gt; LAS &gt; csafe-lab &gt; your_netid (see 5.2) Create a new R script with the following lines of code: # draw 10 samples from normal distribution data = rnorm(10) # put in a dataframe df = data.frame(x=data) # save dataframe write.csv(df, &quot;data.csv&quot;) Save the script as dataframe.R. Copy the script to your csafe-lab work folder. Create a text file for Slurm with the following text: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --nodes=1 # request one node #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 # ask for 1 cpu #SBATCH --mem=1G # asks for 1 GB of RAM #SBATCH --time=00:30:02 # ask that the job be allowed to run for 30 minutes and 2 seconds. # everything below this line is optional #SBATCH --output=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_out.txt # store console output #SBATCH --error=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_err.txt # store error messages module load r cd /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid R --save &lt; dataframe.R Save the file as dataframe.txt. (Windows Only) If you are using Windows, your text file will likely have DOS line breaks instead of UNIX line breaks which will cause an error when the file is run on Pronto. Open Terminal in RStudio, use cd folder/containing/text_file to change directories to the folder containing your text file, and type dos2unix dataframe.txt to change the line breaks to UNIX format. Copy the text file to your csafe-lab work folder. In the command line prompt where you are connected to Pronto, type $ sbatch /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/dataframe.txt This will add your job to the queue. The script is so short, your job will probably run immediately. The dataframe should be saved in a file data.csv in your csafe-lab work folder. There should be two other new files – data.csv, job_&lt;job#&gt;_err.txt and job_&lt;job#&gt;_out.txt – in your csafe-lab work folder as well. If the error file isn’t blank, troubleshoot the error(s). If you get stuck, email researchit@iastate.edu. 5.5.3 Example: Load data from a CSV file In this example, we will load the csv file data.csv that we saved in Example 5.5.2. If you are off campus, connect to the ISU VPN (see ??) Sign-in to Pronto (see 5). Open your csafe-lab work folder prontodtn.las.iastate.edu &gt; work &gt; LAS &gt; csafe-lab &gt; your_netid (see 5.2) Double-check that the file data.csv is still in your csafe-lab work folder. If you deleted it, follow the steps in example 5.5.2 to recreate it. Create a new R script with the following lines of code: df = read.csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;) head(df) Save the script as load.R and copy it to you csafe-lab work folder. Create a text file for Slurm with the following text: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --nodes=1 # request one node #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 # ask for 1 cpu #SBATCH --mem=1G # asks for 1 GB of RAM #SBATCH --time=00:30:02 # ask that the job be allowed to run for 30 minutes and 2 seconds. # everything below this line is optional #SBATCH --output=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_out.txt # store console output #SBATCH --error=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_err.txt # store error messages module load r cd /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid R --save &lt; load.R Save the file as load.txt. (Windows Only) If you are using Windows, your text file will likely have DOS line breaks instead of UNIX line breaks which will cause an error when the file is run on Pronto. Open Terminal in RStudio, use cd folder/containing/text_file to change directories to the folder containing your text file, and type dos2unix load.txt to change the line breaks to UNIX format. Copy the text file to your csafe-lab work folder. In the command line prompt where you are connected to Pronto, type $ sbatch /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/load.txt This will add your job to the queue. The script is so short, your job will probably run immediately. Open the file job_&lt;job#&gt;_out.txt in your csafe-lab work folder and make sure that the first six lines of the dataframe were printed. 5.5.4 Example: Install R packages Just like in Rstudio on your local machine, you will need to install any R packages that you want use. In this example, we will install futile.logger, doParallel, doRNG, and tidyverse so that we can use these packages in future examples. If you are off campus, connect to the ISU VPN (see ??) Sign-in to Pronto (see 5). Open your csafe-lab work folder prontodtn.las.iastate.edu &gt; work &gt; LAS &gt; csafe-lab &gt; your_netid (see 5.2) Create a new R script with the following lines of code: install.packages(c(&quot;futile.logger&quot;, &quot;doParallel&quot;, &quot;doRNG&quot;, &quot;tidyverse&quot;), lib=&quot;/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/Rlibs&quot;, repos=&quot;https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN&quot;) The line starting with lib= tells Pronto to install the R packages in your csafe-lab work folder. The line starting with repos= tells Pronto which CRAN mirror to use. ResearchIT says that these two lines should always be used [https://researchit.las.iastate.edu/how-run-r-pronto]. Save the script as install_packages.R. Copy the script to your csafe-lab work folder. Create a text file for Slurm with the following text: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --nodes=1 # request one node #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 # ask for 1 cpu #SBATCH --mem=1G # asks for 1 GB of RAM #SBATCH --time=00:30:02 # ask that the job be allowed to run for 30 minutes and 2 seconds. # everything below this line is optional #SBATCH --output=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_out.txt # store console output #SBATCH --error=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_err.txt # store error messages export R_LIBS_USER=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/Rlibs mkdir -p $R_LIBS_USER module load r cd /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid R --save &lt; install_packages.R Save the file as install_packages.txt. (Windows Only) If you are using Windows, your text file will likely have DOS line breaks instead of UNIX line breaks which will cause an error when the file is run on Pronto. Open Terminal in RStudio, use cd folder/containing/text_file to change directories to the folder containing your text file, and type dos2unix install_packages.txt to change the line breaks to UNIX format. Copy the text file to your csafe-lab work folder. In the command line prompt where you are connected to Pronto, type $ sbatch /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/install_packages.txt This will add your job to the queue. Just like on your local machine, it might take several minutes to install the packages. There should be two other new files – data.csv, job_&lt;job#&gt;_err.txt and job_&lt;job#&gt;_out.txt – in your csafe-lab work folder. 5.5.5 Example: Run code in parallel The main benefit of Pronto is that it can run code in parallel. In this example, I will show you how to run a for loop in parallel using the doParallel library. R has other packages for parallel computing, but ResearchIT uses doParallel in their how-to [https://researchit.las.iastate.edu/how-run-r-pronto] so that’s what I will use here. If you completed Example 5.5.4 the doParallel package will already be installed. If you need to install the doParallel package see Examples 5.4.2 or 5.5.4 for instructions. If you are off campus, connect to the ISU VPN (see ??) Sign-in to Pronto (see 5). Open your csafe-lab work folder prontodtn.las.iastate.edu &gt; work &gt; LAS &gt; csafe-lab &gt; your_netid (see 5.2) Create a new R script with the following lines of code: library(doParallel) nCores = as.integer(Sys.getenv(&quot;SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK&quot;)) myCluster = parallel::makeCluster(nCores) doParallel::registerDoParallel(myCluster) results = foreach(i=1:10) %dopar% { rnorm(1000)} saveRDS(results, &quot;parallel_results.rds&quot;) Save the script as parallel.R. Copy the script to your csafe-lab work folder. Create a text file for Slurm with the following text: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --nodes=1 # request one node #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10 # ask for 10 cpu #SBATCH --mem=1G # asks for 1 GB of RAM #SBATCH --time=00:30:02 # ask that the job be allowed to run for 30 minutes and 2 seconds. # everything below this line is optional #SBATCH --output=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_out.txt # store console output #SBATCH --error=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_err.txt # store error messages export R_LIBS_USER=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/Rlibs module load r cd /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid R --save &lt; parallel.R Save the file as parallel.txt. (Windows Only) If you are using Windows, your text file will likely have DOS line breaks instead of UNIX line breaks which will cause an error when the file is run on Pronto. Open Terminal in RStudio, use cd folder/containing/text_file to change directories to the folder containing your text file, and type dos2unix parallel.txt to change the line breaks to UNIX format. Copy the text file to your csafe-lab work folder. In the command line prompt where you are connected to Pronto, type $ sbatch /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/parallel.txt The results of the parallel loop should be saved in parallel.txt in your csafe-lab work folder. 5.5.6 Example: Check whether code is running in parallel If you are off campus, connect to the ISU VPN (see ??) Sign-in to Pronto (see 5). Open your csafe-lab work folder prontodtn.las.iastate.edu &gt; work &gt; LAS &gt; csafe-lab &gt; your_netid (see 5.2) Create a new R script with the following lines of code: library(doParallel) library(doRNG) nCores = as.integer(Sys.getenv(&quot;SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK&quot;)) myCluster = parallel::makeCluster(nCores) doParallel::registerDoParallel(myCluster) r1 = foreach(i=1:10) %dorng% { if (i==1){Sys.sleep(30)} time = Sys.time() saveRDS(object=time, file=paste0(&quot;time_&quot;, i,&quot;.rds&quot;)) } Save the script as check_parallel.R. Copy the script to your csafe-lab work folder. Create a text file for Slurm with the following text: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --nodes=1 # request one node #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=10 # ask for 10 cpu #SBATCH --mem=1G # asks for 1 GB of RAM #SBATCH --time=00:30:02 # ask that the job be allowed to run for 30 minutes and 2 seconds. # everything below this line is optional #SBATCH --output=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_out.txt # store console output #SBATCH --error=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/job_%J_err.txt # store error messages export R_LIBS_USER=/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/Rlibs module load r cd /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid R --save &lt; check_parallel.R Save the file as check_parallel.txt. (Windows Only) If you are using Windows, your text file will likely have DOS line breaks instead of UNIX line breaks which will cause an error when the file is run on Pronto. Open Terminal in RStudio, use cd folder/containing/text_file to change directories to the folder containing your text file, and type dos2unix check_parallel.txt to change the line breaks to UNIX format. Copy the text file to your csafe-lab work folder. In the command line prompt where you are connected to Pronto, type $ sbatch /work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/check_parallel.txt The script should have created 10 RDS files in your csafe-lab work folder. Check the times recorded in each file. The first file should contain a time after the other files. 5.5.7 Example: Set the seed for the random number generator If you run Example 5.5.5 multiple times, the numbers sampled from the normal distribution will likely be different each time. If you want to make the sample reproducible (produce the same sample each time), set the seed for the random number generator. The most common way to set a seed is with the set.seed() function. This function does not work with %dopar% from the doParallel package, but it does work with %dorng%. If you are off campus, connect to the ISU VPN (see ??) Sign-in to Pronto (see 5).

The handwriter package requires a number of other R packages, some of which caused errors when I tried to install handwriter in an interactive session on Pronto following the instructions in 5.4.2. ResearchIT helped me figure out how to install the problem packages and ultimately install handwriter. This section records the step-by-step details of how I was able to install handwriter. My hope is that you will also be able to sucessfully install handwriter if you follow these steps. If you run into problems, email researchit@iastate.edu. If you are off campus, connect to the ISU VPN (see ??) Sign-in to Pronto (see 5). Some of the packages used by handwriter are only available on Pronto for R 4.0.4. Start the R 4.0.4 interpreter in an interactive session on Pronto. $ srun --nodes 1 --tasks 4 --partition interactive --time 01:00:00 --pty bash $ module purge $ module load gcc/10.2.0-zuvaafu $ module load r/4.0.4-py3-4khjixy $ R Try to install the handwriter package &gt; install.packages(&quot;handwriter&quot;,lib=&quot;/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/Rlibs&quot;, repos=&quot;https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN&quot;) I received error messages stating that the packages igraph, randomForest, and magick could not be installed. I had to install these packages separately. Install igraph &gt; install.packages(&quot;igraph&quot;,lib=&quot;/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/Rlibs&quot;, repos=&quot;https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN&quot;) Then randomForest &gt; install.packages(&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/randomForest/randomForest_4.6-14.tar.gz&quot;, repos=NULL, type=&quot;source&quot;,lib=&quot;/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/Rlibs&quot;) Install magick &gt; install.packages(&quot;magick&quot;, configure.vars=c(&quot;INCLUDE_DIR=&#39;. -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 -fopenmp -DMAGICKCORE_HDRI_ENABLE=1 -DMAGICKCORE_QUANTUM_DEPTH=16 -I/opt/rit/spack-app/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/image-magick-7.0.5-9-6xplmhr3zv6pu2frzsuyof2coe4tuguh/include/ImageMagick-7&#39; LIB_DIR=&#39;. -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 -Wl,-rpath,/opt/rit/spack-app/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/image-magick-7.0.5-9-6xplmhr3zv6pu2frzsuyof2coe4tuguh/lib -L/opt/rit/spack-app/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/image-magick-7.0.5-9-6xplmhr3zv6pu2frzsuyof2coe4tuguh/lib -lMagick++-7.Q16HDRI -lMagickWand-7.Q16HDRI -lMagickCore-7.Q16HDRI #&#39;&quot;), lib=&quot;/work/LAS/csafe-lab/your_netid/Rlibs&quot;, repos=&quot;https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN&quot;) 5.8 Trouble-Shooting 5.8.1 Line breaks error If you are using Windows and you try to run a text file created on Windows on Pronto, you will likely get the following error: sbatch: error: Batch script contains DOS line breaks (\\\\r\\\\n) sbatch: error: instead of expected UNIX line breaks (\\\\n). One way to fix the problem is to - Open Rstudio - Go to Tools &gt; Terminal &gt; New Terminal - Changes the directory to the folder containing basic.txt by typing ‘cd /documents/my/folder’ without the quotes and hitting enter. - Type ‘dos2unix basic.txt’ without the quotes and hit enter.
