# Getting Started
If you are working from off campus you need to use ISU's virtual private network (VPN) to connect to any of the computing resources covered in this guide. You also need to set up SSH keys. Section \ref@(off-campus) explains how to install and use the ISU VPN and SSH keys. If you will only be working on campus, you may skip this section.

This chapter also includes a Quick Start Guide (Section \ref@(quick-start)) for people who are already comfortable with virtual private networks and command line prompts. 

The last section in this chapter explains how people are granted access to the computing resources covered in this guide.
