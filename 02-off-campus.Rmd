# Getting Started

## Getting Access
The Center for Survey Statistics & Methodology (CSSM) manages access to the Large Scale Storage (LSS) and the CSAFE RStudio Servers. Each CSAFE project has a list of people that work on that project. CSSM grants everyone on a project's list access to that project's folder on LSS. If you are unable to connect to LSS or the CSAFE RStudio Servers, contact Kristen Hanson at khanson3 at iastate dot edu. She will make sure that you are on the appropriate CSAFE project list.

### Generate SSH keys {#ssh-keys}
ResearchIT gives instructions for setting up SSH keys at https://researchit.las.iastate.edu/how-generate-ssh-keys. Setting up my SSH keys took lots of trial and error. If you run into problems or get stuck, email researchit@iastate.edu.
